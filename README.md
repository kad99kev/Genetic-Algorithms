# Genetic-Algorithms

### Purpose
* This repository was initially created to learn about Genetic Algorithms back when I was in my Second Year (2018-2019) of Engineering.

* However, since then I've worked on different projects that use GA and as a result, this has remained underdeveloped.

* So instead I shall link all my projects that make use of GAs upto some extent, along with some references that I found useful while I was working on it

### Projects
1. [PyBoxCar](https://github.com/kad99kev/PyBoxCar) - A BoxCar2D implementation in Python
2. [NeuroSteer](https://github.com/kad99kev/NeuroSteer) - Neuro-evolution in steering of autonomous agents using tensorflow.js
3. [JumperNN](https://github.com/kad99kev/Jumper-NN) - Small JavaScript game using p5.js (similar to the dinosaur game found in chrome)
